values left in the file (besides the one in this introduction of course).

Warmup and Debugging Exercise
-----------------------------
Q1: What is the value of the totalMoves variable in hanoiAnimationafter stepping over the call to moveTower?
A1: TODO

Q2: What is the value of the totalMoves variable inside the first moveTower call after stepping over its first recursive sub-call? (In other words, just after stepping over the first recursive sub-call to moveTower inside the else statement in the recursive function.)
A2: TODO

Q3: After breaking at the base case of moveTower and then choosing Step Out, where do you end up? (What function are you in, and at what line number?) What is the value of the totalMoves variable at this point?
A3: TODO

Q4: What is the smallest possible input that triggers the bug?
A4: TODO

Q5: What is the one-character error in the program?
A5: TODO

Q6: Explain why that one-character bug causes the function to return the exact output you see when you feed in the input you provided in Q5. You should be able to specifically account for where things go wrong and how the place where the error occurs causes the result to change from “completely correct” to “terribly wrong.”
A6: TODO


Merge
-----
Q7: Give a rough estimate of the maximum length sequence that could be successfully merged on your system assuming a recursive implementation of binary merge.
A7: TODO

Q8: What would be the observed behavior if attempting to merge a sequence larger than that maximum?
A8: TODO 

Q9: Include the data from your execution timing and explain how is supports your Big O prediction for merge.
A9: TODO

Q10. Include the data from your execution timing and explain how it supports your Big O prediction for multiMerge.
A10: TODO

Q11: Include the data from your execution timing and explain how it supports O(n log k) behavior for recMultiMerge.
A11: TODO

Q12: Earlier you worked out how a recursive implementation of merge would limit the allowable input sequence length. Are the limits on the call stack also an issue for the recursive implementation of recMultiMerge? Explain why or why not.
A12: TODO

Voting
------
Q13: Include the data from your execution timing and explain how is supports your Big O prediction for computePowerIndex.
A13: TODO

Q14: Use the timing and Big O to predict how long it would take to compute the power index for the 51 voting blocks in the US electoral system.
A14: TODO
