Warmup and Debugging Exercise
-----------------------------
Q1. If looking at a call stack, what would be the indication that the program being debugged uses recursion?
A1: TODO


Q2: What is the value of parameter `n` at level 0 in the call stack? What is the highest numbered level shown in the call stack? (This gives a rough estimate of the capacity of the space set aside for the call stack on your system.)
A2: TODO


Q3:  Describe the difference in observed symptoms of a program that goes into an infinite loop versus one that goes into infinite recursion
A3: TODO


Q4. What are the specific values of base/exp that result in a test failure?
A4: TODO


Q5: Explain why removing the redundant base cases fixed the test failure.
A5: TODO

Q6: What is the result of attempting to compute 0 raised to a negative power without a special case for base == 0?
A6: TODO


Balance
-------
Q7. Compare your recursion solution to the iterative approach used for the check Balance problem in Section1. Which version do you find easier to write? to read? to confirm correct?
A7: TODO 

Sierpinski
-----------
Q8.  Without automated unit tests, you need to develop new techniques for test coverage. What were the strategies you used for testing Sierpinski?
A8: TODO
